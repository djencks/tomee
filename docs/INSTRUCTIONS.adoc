= Building docs with Antora

Follow the instructios on the Antora site for installing Antora or using the docker container.

Run `./update-examples.sh` in this directory.
You must run it in this directory!!!
This copies and renames all the README[_lang].adoc files from the examples into an Antora structure.
Unless you change one of these, you don't need to run the script again.

Run `antora antora-playbook.yml`

== Author mode

The `antora-playbook.yml` playbook is set up so all but this `antora` branch are retrieved from remote git.
This lets you work on "HEAD" documentation and build the site immediately and see your changes.
You can also check out the content in `tomee-site-generator` locally and work on it.
In this case you will want to alter the playbook to point to the local filesystem checkout.
There's a commented-out suggestion in the playbook that fits my filesystem layout.
