== Container

TomEE specific configuration (ie not inherited one from Tomcat) is based on properties. Therefore
you can fully configure TomEE using properties in `conf/system.properties`.
However for convenience it also provides a hybrid XML alternative a.k.a. `conf/tomee.xml`.

== Application

Some settings can be specific to applications, these ones are also properties based and
are read in `WEB-INF/application.properties`. When you can't use `tomee.xml` to configure
resources you can use `WEB-INF/resources.xml` which inherit from `tomee.xml` its syntax
but binds the resources to the application and reuses the application classloader.
