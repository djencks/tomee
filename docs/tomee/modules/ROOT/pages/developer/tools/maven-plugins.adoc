//Not in common
TomEE provides several maven plugins:

* one for a xref:developer/tools/maven/tomee.adoc[standalone TomEE]
* one for xref:developer/tools/maven/embedded.adoc[TomEE embedded]
* one for xref:developer/tools/maven/applicationcomposer.adoc[application composer] based applications
* Note: there is one for `EJBContainer` but this one is easily replaced by one of the previous in general
