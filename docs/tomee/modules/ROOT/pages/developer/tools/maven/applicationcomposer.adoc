//Not in common
This plugin has two goals:

* `applicationcomposer:run`: to start the application from mvn command line
* `applicationcomposer:zip`: to package a zip with dependencies and start scripts

IMPORTANT: The dependencies are retrieved with `MavenProject.getArtifacts()` which means your artifacts should be a `war`
- maven doesn't populate it with a `jar` - and the compile phase - at least - should be passed to ensure it is populated.
